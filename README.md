# Autohotkey
Contains my Autohotkey mappings for various kaomoji and mouse shortcuts. Download and install from https://www.autohotkey.com/. Clone the AHK file into your startup folder (type "shell:startup" in your explorer address bar).  Then whenever you type any of the strings below, they'll get replaced in real time with the corresponding kaomoji.
